David Meade, a Christan numerologist, believed the rapture would be occuring on September 23rd, 2017, apparently because it was 33 days after a solar eclipse and 33 is how long Jesus lived and because the name of God appeared 33 times in the New Testemant and something about the planet Nibiru.  Or, possibly in October, after the first prediction failed to come to pass.

NASA did point out that there is no planet Nibiru.  Meade later predicted it may happen in 2018, which also didn't occur.
