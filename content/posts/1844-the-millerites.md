+++

The Millerite movement, led by Baptist preacher William Miller, predicted that Jesus Christ would return to Earth on October 22, 1844. This date was calculated based on Miller's interpretation of biblical prophecies, particularly the 2,300-day prophecy from the book of Daniel.

## The Great Disappointment

When October 22, 1844, came and went without the expected Second Coming, many of Miller's followers experienced what became known as "The Great Disappointment." Some abandoned their faith entirely, while others reinterpreted the prophecy and bacame the Adventists, who are still sure the rapture is right around the corner.  Metaphorically.

## Legacy and Influence

Despite the failed prediction, the Millerite movement had lasting influence on American religious thought and gave rise to several new denominations, including the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The movement also contributed to the broader tradition of American millennialism and end-times speculation.

The Millerite experience serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of setting specific dates for prophetic fulfillment, while also demonstrating how religious movements can adapt and evolve even after major disappointments.
