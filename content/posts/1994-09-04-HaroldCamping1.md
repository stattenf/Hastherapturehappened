title = 'Family Radio and Harold Camping'
+++

Harold Camping, a Christian scholar and numerologist, first predicted the world would end on May 21st, 1998.  It didn't, if you notice.  Later in 1998 he published a book giving a set of dates leading up to 1994 when it might happen, just to keep everyone on their toes being nice rather than naughty.  Each of these possible dates came and went with a stunning lack of a rapture.

Normally, being wrong this often would result in shunning, or possibly being elected to high office, but neither happened.  Camping continued to grow his Family Radio network, hosting and taking calls and also donations, if his listeners were into that.  Don't forget the name Harold Camping, because it comes up again.
