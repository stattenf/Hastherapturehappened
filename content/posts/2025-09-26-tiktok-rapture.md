Users of TikTok, based on a claim by South African Pastor Joshua Mhlakela, believed that the Rapture would happen on September 23, 2025.  Or possibly September 24, 2025, since Revelations was unaware of the existence of time zones and the international date line.

Some people sold all their worldly possesions before this event, although it's unclear why they would feel the need to collect money for their worldly possessions just before being swept up to Heaven, since we know you don't get to take your money with you.

Unless you do get to take it with you.  Science is still investigating.
