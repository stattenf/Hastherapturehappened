+++

Harold Camping, the President of FamilyRadio and based out of Oakland, confidently predicted that the world would end on May 11, 2011, because it was 4990 years after the Great Flood that mostly drenched the world.  He had previously confidently predicted the world would end in May of 1998, then in 2008, but this 2011 prediction was definately correct, he said.

He and his ministry raised money to buy billboards and other advertising letting everyone know.  People sold their worldly belongings in preperation and gathered together to await the end on the morning of May 11th.  When May 12th came to pass, Harold went back and determined that he meant October 11th, 2011, this time for sure.

Harold Camping passed away two years later, in 2013.  After his October prediction passed uneventfully, he let everyone know that he wasn't going to make any more predictions about the Rapture.
